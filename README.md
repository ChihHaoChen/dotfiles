#Jack's Dotfiles

My dotfiles for Vim and ZSH. Shamelessly stolen from tonnes of dotfile repositories I found online. 

#Plugins

Plugins are all managed with Pathogen, and added to the update_bundles script in `~/.vim/update_bundles`.

The make file is very much set up for my system. When setting up Command-T it presumes rbenv exists.
